Hopper,yMD ,\\nThais Dutra Vieira, *zMD , Joao Pedro Campos, *MD, Abdo El Helou, *MD,\\nCorentin Philippe, *MD, Adnan Saithna,§MD , and Bertrand Sonnery-Cottet, *MD\\nInvestigation performed at Centre Orthopedique Santy, Lyon, France\\nBackground: Bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) autografts are widely considered the standard for anterior cruciate ligament\\nreconstruction (ACLR).\\nPurpose/Hypothesis: The aims of this study were to compare the clinical outcomes after ACLR with gold standard BPTB auto-\\ngrafts versus combined ACLR 1anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) with hamstring tendon (HT) autografts at medium-\\nterm follow-up in a large series of propensity-matched patients. The hypothesis was that combined ACLR 1ALLR with HT auto-\\ngrafts would result in lower graft rupture rates and non–graft rupture-related reoperation rates.\\nStudy Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.\\nMethods: Patients undergoing combined ACLR 1ALLR using HT autografts between January 2003 and December 2019 were\\npropensity matched in a 1:1 ratio to patients undergoing isolated ACLR using BPTB autografts. At the end of the study period,graft ruptures, contralateral knee injuries, and any other reoperations or complications after the index procedure were identified\\nby a search of a prospective database and a review of medical records.\\nResults: A total of 1009 matched pairs were included. The mean duration of follow-up was 101.3 659.9 months. Patients in the\\nisolated group were .3-fold more likely to have graft failure than those in the combined group (hazard ratio, 3.554 [95% CI, 1.744-\\n7.243]; P= .0005). Patients aged \\\\20 years were at a particularly high risk of graft ruptures compared with patients aged .30\\nyears (hazard ratio, 5.650 [95% CI, 1.834-17.241]; P= .0002). Additionally, there was a significantly higher reoperation rate after\\nisolated ACLR than after combined ACLR 1ALLR (20.5% vs 8.9%, respectively; P\\\\.0001). The overall rate of subsequent con-\\ntralateral ruptures was 9.1% after index surgery (isolated: 10.2%; combined: 8.0%; P= .0934), indicating that the risk profiles for\\nboth groups were similar.\\nConclusion: Patients who underwent isolated ACLR with BPTB autografts experienced significantly worse graft survivorship and\\noverall reoperation-free survivorship compared with those who underwent combined ACLR 1ALLR with HT autografts. The risk\\nof graft ruptures was .3-fold higher in patients who underwent isolated ACLR using BPTB autografts.\\nKeywords: ACL reconstruction; anterolateral ligament reconstruction; lateral extra-articular procedures; long-term follow-up\\nBone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) autografts have widely\\nbeen considered the standard for anterior cruciate liga-ment (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR), particularly in the\\nUnited States, and especially for high-demand athleticpatients at an increased risk of graft ruptures. Historical\\nsurveys of National Football League, National CollegiateAthletic Association, Major League Soccer, and National\\nBasketball Association team physicians have all demon-\\nstrated a strong preference for BPTB grafts.\\n11,12,27This\\npreference appears to hold true in contemporary practicebecause a 2018 survey of members of the AOSSM and\\nthe Arthroscopy Association of North America also\\nreported a significant and continued preference for BPTBThe American Journal of Sports Medicine\\n1–9DOI: 10.1177/03635465221128261/C2112022 The Author(s)\\n1\\n', '\\ngrafts in younger, pivoting athletes.5These findings do not\\nreflect overall practice patterns within the United States\\nor global trends. In contrast, similar surveys conducted\\nin Australia and Brazil have demonstrated a preferencefor hamstring tendon (HT) grafts over BPTB grafts in pro-\\nfessional athletes.\\n2,23Furthermore, a systematic review of\\nrecent national surveys19(including 8 countries from\\nEurope, Asia, North America, and Latin America) demon-strated a current preference for HT grafts in each of the\\nincluded countries (45%-95% of the clinicians surveyed).\\nA historical perspective on these changing practice pat-terns was provided by the ACL Study Group, who reported\\nthat although BPTB grafts were clearly favored in the\\n1990s and early 2000s, HT autografts are now more fre-quently utilized by its membership than BPTB grafts and\\nhave been since around 2008.\\n3Possible reasons for this\\ntrend include the failure of several meta-analyses toshow clinically important advantages of one graft type\\nover the other with respect to knee stability, patient-\\nreported outcome scores, or graft rupture rates, coupledwith concerns about higher rates of osteoarthritis, exten-sion deficits, and donor-site morbidity with BPTB grafts.\\nDespite the obvious challenges posed for BPTB grafts by\\nglobal practice patterns, it is our opinion that thereremains a somewhat dogmatic belief that BPTB grafts\\nare associated with better knee stability and lower rates\\nof graft ruptures than HT grafts as well as with better clin-ical results in young, high-demand athletic patients. How-\\never, this has not been evidenced by meta-analyses, and\\nany statistically significant differences are likely to besmall. In contrast, significantly reduced graft rupturerates have been reported in young patients\\n22participating\\nin pivoting sports with combined ACLR 1anterolateral\\nligament (ALL) reconstruction (ALLR) using HT auto-grafts to create a single graft construct for both reconstruc-\\ntion procedures. This suggests that the former might be\\na better graft choice than the established standard. Limita-tions of that study included its retrospective and non-\\nmatched design. There remains a belief that lateral\\nextra-articular procedures may only be necessary withsoft tissue ACL grafts and that they do not confer an\\nimportant advantage when added to BPTB grafts.\\n30\\nThe aims of this study were to compare the clinical out-\\ncomes after ACLR with gold standard BPTB autografts ver-sus combined ACLR 1ALLR with HT autografts at\\nmedium-term follow-up in a large series of propensity-\\nmatched patients. The hypothesis was that combined ACLR\\n1ALLR with HT autografts would have lower graft rupture\\nrates and non–graft rupture-related reoperation rates.METHODS\\nStudy Design and Participants\\nInstitutional review board approval (COS-RGDS-2022-03-\\n002-SONNERY COTTET-B) was granted for this study.A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data\\nfrom the Santy database was performed. Patients who\\nunderwent either isolated ACLR with BPTB autograftsor combined ACLR 1ALLR using HT autografts, per-\\nformed between January 2003 and December 2019, were\\neligible for the study. The diagnosis of an ACL graft rup-ture was made based on a clinical examination and mag-netic resonance imaging. The indications for combined\\nreconstruction (ACLR 1ALLR) increased over the study\\nperiod and included a high-grade pivot shift, chronic inju-ries, hyperlaxity, and young patients participating in piv-\\noting sports.\\n43Patients were excluded only if they\\nunderwent double-bundle ACLR, underwent major con-comitant procedures (including multiligament reconstruc-\\ntion or osteotomy), or did not have a minimum 2-year\\nfollow-up.\\nSurgical Technique\\nAll surgical procedures were performed by the senior\\nauthor (B.S.-C.) in accordance with previously published\\ndescriptions, as summarized in the following sections. Allpatients were placed in a supine position with the knee\\nflexed to 90 /C176. A lateral support, foot roll, and tourniquet\\nwere utilized. Arthroscopic inspection of the knee andmeniscal surgery were performed before ACLR.\\nIsolated ACLR With BPTB Graft. A 10-mm BPTB graft\\nwas harvested with a 9 315–mm patellar bone plug and\\nan 11 320–mm tibial bone plug. The femoral tunnel\\nwas drilled in an outside-in fashion.

Intra-\\narticularly, this was placed in a mid–anteromedial bundle\\nposition; laterally, it was positioned at the femoral origin\\nof the ALL (proximal and posterior to the lateral epicon-dyle).

This consisted\\nof brace-free, immediate full weightbearing and progres-sive range of motion exercises, with a restriction in range\\nof motion from 0 /C176to 90 /C176for 6 weeks for patients who under-\\nwent meniscal repair.

The physical examination included the Lachmantest and an evaluation of anteroposterior side-to-side laxity\\ndifferences measured using a Rolimeter (Aircast).\\nThe study end date was set to January 1, 2022. The final\\nfollow-up for each patient was defined as the last follow-up\\nbefore this date, as recorded in prospectively collected data\\nfrom the Santy database. Patient notes were reviewed byan investigator (L.G., A.E.H. or C.Ph.), independent of\\nthe primary surgeons, to determine if any patient had sus-\\ntained a further ipsilateral knee injury, sustained a contra-lateral knee injury, had undergone any reoperations, or\\nhad any complications after the index procedure. Key\\ndemographics and additional secondary surgery were alsodocumented.\\nPropensity Score Matching\\nPropensity score matching was undertaken to mitigate the\\neffects of any possible treatment selection bias and allow\\nthe creation of 2 groups (isolated and combined groups)in which confounding factors were balanced. A propensityscore was determined for each patient based on the follow-\\ning criteria: age at the time of surgery ( \\\\20, 20-30, or .30\\nyears), sex, body mass index according to the World HealthOrganization classification,\\n31participation in pivoting\\nsports, participation in contact sports, and preinjury\\nTegner score.

After the application of exclusion criteria,\\n3160 patients were identified as potentially eligible for\\nfinal inclusion (1017 isolated and 2143 combined). Everypatient from the isolated group was propensity matched\\nto a single best-matched patient from the combined group\\n(Figure 2).\\nTable 1 demonstrates that matching was successful in\\nachieving a covariate balance between groups, with all cri-\\nteria having absolute standardized coefficients \\\\0.25 (as\\nper the predetermined threshold). The demographics of\\nthe study population, stratified by group, according to\\nthe criteria used for propensity matching are reported inTable 1. These variables all indicated that propensitymatching was successful and that the groups were similar\\nenough to allow reliable comparisons. Furthermore, the\\noverall rate of contralateral ACL ruptures was 9.1% afterindex surgery, and there was no significant difference\\nbetween groups, again reflecting that the groups were\\nwell matched in terms of risk (isolated: 10.2%; combined:\\n8.0%; P= .0934). Table 2 summarizes the time between\\ninjury and surgery, the anteroposterior side-to-side laxity\\ndifference, and the frequency of meniscal and chondral\\nlesions. However, as expected, there was a significant dif-ference in the mean follow-up between groups, reflectinga trend toward more frequent use of combined procedures\\nthroughout the study period. The mean follow-up was\\n101.3659.9 months. In the isolated group, the mean final\\nfollow-up was 136.8 months (range, 25.9-228.2 months),\\nand in the combined group, it was 65.9 months (range,\\n24.1-142.2 months) ( P\\\\.0001).\\nClinical Outcomes\\nAt 1 year postoperatively, no significant differences were\\nseen in the anteroposterior side-to-side laxity difference\\nbetween the groups. The mean side-to-side laxity differ-\\nence using a Rolimeter was 0.6 61.2 mm in the isolated\\ngroup and 0.4 61.1 mm in the combined group ( P=\\n.071). At the end of the study period, there were significant\\ndifferences between the isolated and combined groups withrespect to graft rupture rates (9.9% vs 3.5%, respectively;P\\\\.0001) (Table 3) and overall reoperation rates (20.5%\\nvs 8.9%, respectively; P\\\\.0001) (Table 4).\\nSurvivorship and Risk Analyses\\nKaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly better\\ngraft survivorship in the combined group compared withthe isolated group at every time point assessed (Figure 3).\\nMultivariate analysis was performed using a Cox model\\nto include age, sex, graft type (BPTB or HT), meniscallesions, and participation in contact sports and pivoting\\nsports. The Cox model was used to estimate the risk of\\ngraft ruptures, per unit of exposure time, and explore rela-tionships with potential explanatory variables. This\\nrevealed that patients undergoing isolated ACLR with\\na BPTB graft were .3-fold more likely to have graft failure\\nthan those who underwent combined ACLR 1ALLR with\\nan HT graft (hazard ratio [HR], 3.554 [95% CI, 1.744-\\n7.243]; P= .0005).

None of the other factors investi-\\ngated demonstrated statistical significance.\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe main findings of this study were that patients whounderwent isolated ACLR with BPTB autografts experi-enced significantly higher rates of graft ruptures and reop-\\nerations than those who underwent combined ACLR 1\\nALLR with HT autografts. When the possible effects of sig-nificantly different durations of follow-up between groups\\nwere accounted for (by using time-to-event analyses that\\nwere independent of overall durations of follow-up), thesefindings were confirmed. Specifically, patients who under-\\nwent ACLR with BPTB grafts had significantly worse ACL\\ngraft survivorship and overall reoperation-free survivor-ship at every time point analyzed compared with those\\nwho underwent ACLR 1ALLR with HT autografts. Fur-\\nthermore, the risks of graft ruptures and overall reopera-tions were more than 3.5 and 1.7 times higher,respectively, in patients who underwent isolated ACLR\\nwith BPTB autografts. These findings are consistent with\\nnumerous previous comparative studies demonstratingsignificant advantages of combined ACLR 1lateral\\nextra-articular procedures with respect to graft rupture\\nrates compared with isolated ACLR.\\n6,14,18,22,45\\nIt was also an important finding that there were signif-\\nicant differences between groups with respect to the occur-\\nrence of non–graft rupture-related reoperations. The rateof reoperations for symptomatic cyclops lesions in the iso-\\nlated group was more than double that in the combined\\ngroup (4.3% [n = 43] vs 1.7% [n = 17], respectively; P=\\n.0094). Because all reoperations for symptomatic cyclopslesions occurred before 24 months after the index proce-\\ndure, this difference between groups cannot be accounted\\nfor by differences in the follow-up duration. Instead, thefinding is consistent with numerous reports that extension\\ndeficits are more common with BPTB grafts.\\n1,13,37,46This is\\nan important observation because an extension deficit inthe early postoperative period has recently been estab-\\nlished as an important risk factor for the development of\\nsymptomatic cyclops lesions.\\n10,34\\nAdditionally, the rate of secondary meniscectomy was\\nsignificantly lower in the combined group. This finding is\\nconsistent with previous work by Sonnery-Cottet et al,44\\nwhich demonstrated that in patients who underwent\\nrepair of the medial meniscus at the time of ACLR, those\\nundergoing concomitant ALLR had a 2-fold reduction in\\nsecondary meniscectomy rates. These findings were attrib-uted to better restoration of normal knee kinematics and\\nload sharing with repair.\\nA further key finding of this study was that there were\\nno significant differences between groups with respect to\\nthe anteroposterior side-to-side laxity difference. These\\nfindings are consistent with several meta-analyses thathave demonstrated no significant differences in knee laxityparameters between HT and BPTB grafts.\\n4,8,38,48\\nOverall, it is our opinion that there has been a widely,\\nand sometimes dogmatically, held belief that BPTBautografts are the standard graft choice for ACLR. Indeed,\\nthis strong preference for BPTB grafts is noted within the\\ncurrent study, with a large number of patients undergoing\\nACLR with BPTB grafts early in the study period, but it isgradually being superseded by a preference for ACLR 1\\nALLR with HT grafts in view of observed clinical advan-\\ntages later in the study period. Similarly, practice patternsin both the United States and globally have demonstratedan increasing trend away from BPTB grafts, in preference\\nfor soft tissue grafts, in contemporary practice.\\n40Of note,\\nthe use of quadriceps tendon (QT) autografts has dramati-cally increased in the past few years.\\n29,41A recent meta-\\nanalysis comparing BPTB, HT, and QT grafts reported\\na lack of important differences between groups withrespect to knee stability, graft rupture rates, and the Inter-\\nnational Knee Documentation Committee subjective score,\\nbut did identify significantly lower rates of donor-site mor-bidity with QT grafts than with either of the other choices.\\n9\\nIt is seemingly the case that the trend away from BPTBgrafts has been driven by concerns about donor-site mor-bidity (especially anterior knee pain)\\n7,16and higher rates\\nof extension deficits.1,13,37,46However, it is clear that all\\ngraft choices have pros and cons, and the optimum graft\\nchoice remains a controversial topic. It is therefore ouropinion that ACL graft choice should be individualized\\naccording to patient/surgeon factors. However, it is also\\nclear, considering the findings of this study and previouscomparative studies, that combined ACLR 1ALLR offers\\nsignificant advantages over isolated ACLR.\\n20,24,35,45The\\ncurrent study poses a challenge to the widely held beliefthat BPTB grafts are the standard for ACLR because sig-nificant advantages have been demonstrated with HT\\ngrafts when used as a single graft construct to perform\\ncombined ACLR 1ALLR, without evidence of inferior\\nknee stability. Further evaluations with a randomized con-\\ntrolled trial are needed to confirm these findings.\\nA further important finding of this study was that youn-\\nger age ( \\\\20 years) was also a significant risk factor for\\ngraft ruptures on multivariate analysis. This is not an\\nunexpected finding because many previous studies havereported age to be an important risk factor for graft failure\\nand a predictor of early revision ACLR.\\n15,21,25,26,33,39,42The\\ncurrent study demonstrates that patients aged \\\\20 years\\nhad a .5-fold higher risk of graft ruptures compared\\nwith patients aged .30 years ( P= .0002). It is precisely\\nthis increased risk of graft ruptures in young patients\\nthat has led to a preference for the gold standard BPTBgraft in this population. However, the subgroup analysis\\nin this study demonstrated that in this so called at-risk\\npopulation, graft rupture rates were .3-fold higher with\\nisolated ACLR using BPTB grafts compared with combined\\nACLR 1ALLR using HT grafts. These findings are consis-\\ntent with numerous comparative studies of other high-riskpopulations demonstrating the advantages of combinedreconstruction.\\n22\\nIt was anticipated that there would be significant differ-\\nences in the duration of follow-up between the groupsbecause of the larger proportion of patients undergoing com-\\nbined reconstruction toward the latter part of the study\\nperiod. For that reason, statistical methods that wereAJSM Vol. XX, No. X, XXXX ACLR 1ALLR Versus ACLR With BPTB Grafts 7', '\\nunaffected by any differences in the duration of follow-up\\nbetween groups were used to evaluate graft survivorship,\\nreoperation-free survivorship, and the significance of poten-\\ntially important risk factors. Specifically, Kaplan-Meieranalysis was used because it is widely recognized as one of\\nthe best ways to analyze time-to-event data. It provides an\\nestimation of survivorship unaffected by differences in theduration of follow-up between groups. The estimate involvescalculating the probabilities of the occurrence of events at\\nspecified time points and multiplying these successive prob-\\nabilities by earlier computed probabilities to obtain a finalestimate. Additionally, Cox proportional hazards modeling\\nwas used to evaluate differences in the risk of graft ruptures\\nbetween groups and the influence of potentially importantrisk factors. This model was also specifically chosen because\\nit was also unaffected by differences in the duration of fol-\\nlow-up between groups. This is because it expresses theinstantaneous risk of an event as a function of time. It\\ndoes so by considering the individual follow-up period for\\neach patient in addition to the occurrence of the event,and therefore, the estimation of risk is unbiased by differen-ces between groups with respect to the duration of follow-\\nup. Specifically, in this study, the principle of the Cox model\\nwas to associate the date of the occurrence of an event (graftrupture/failure or reoperation) with a type of treatment (iso-\\nlated ACLR with BPTB autograft vs combined ACLR 1\\nALLR with HT autograft), completely independent of theoverall follow-up duration.\\nThe main limitations of this study were its retrospective\\nand nonrandomized design. Although the inherent weak-nesses of these types of studies are well recognized, it isimportant to highlight that the rationale for choosing\\nthis design was to take advantage of the fact that retro-\\nspective studies offer the ability to easily examine verylarge study populations with a long-term follow-up.\\nAttempts to mitigate any potential effects of treatment\\nselection bias were made by propensity matching, andthe success of doing so is reflected in not only the absolute\\nstandardized difference but also the finding that there\\nwere no significant differences between groups withrespect to contralateral graft rupture rates, indicating\\nthat both groups had similar risk profiles. A further limita-\\ntion of the study was significant differences in the durationof follow-up between groups. This was addressed by utiliz-ing statistical methods that use time-to-event data that are\\nindependent of, and therefore unbiased by, differences in\\nthe overall follow-up duration. Finally, data about returnto sports were not available.\\nCONCLUSION\\nPatients who underwent isolated ACLR with BPTB auto-\\ngrafts experienced significantly worse ACL graft survivor-\\nship and overall reoperation-free survivorship comparedwith those who underwent combined ACLR 1ALLR\\nwith HT autografts. The risk of graft ruptures was .3-\\nfold higher in patients who underwent isolated ACLR\\nusing BPTB autografts.ORCID iDs\\nThais Dutra Vieira https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1624-\\n1824Charles Pioger\\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-1180-4955\\nGraeme P.
